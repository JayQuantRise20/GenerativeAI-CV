In this project we will build a nice web app that allows you to swap out the background of a subject and substitute it with an image generated by Stable Diffusion through a text prompt:


## Project Instructions
When you start the workspace you will land in a Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions contained there step by step, being on the lookout for sections marked by YOUR CODE HERE.

The gradio app that allows for the interactive experience showcased above is already built for you, you will be able to start it from within the notebook. Then, by clicking on a link, you will be taken to a new tab with the gradio UI available for use.

After completing the code, spend some time playing around in the app. Try to modify the parameters like the Classifier-Free Guidance Scale or the random seed - which you now understand - and see which results you get.
